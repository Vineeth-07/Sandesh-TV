Section 1: Network Decisions and Justification

Requirement 1: Secure Connection for EXEC and HR

Implementation:

Use an Ethernet link to connect MAN_HO EXEC and MAN_HO HR directly.
Use IPsec to secure communication over this link.

Justification:

Ethernet delivers a simple, high-speed connection.
IPsec protects the security and integrity of sensitive data sent between MAN_HO EXEC and MAN_HO HR.

Requirement 2: Implementation of MPLS VPN Connection for HR, PRODUCTION 1, and LOGISTICS:

Implementation:

Connect MAN_HO HR, LDS PRODUCTION 1, and NCL LOGISTICS via a full-mesh MPLS VPN.

Justification:

Full-mesh MPLS VPN enables private, smooth communication between designated locations.

Requirement 3: MPLS VPN Link for EXEC to NCL R&D with IPsec
Implementation:

A direct MPLS VPN connection exists between MAN_HO EXEC and NCL R&D.
Only use IPsec for the connectivity to NCL R&D LAN A.

Justification:

A dedicated, efficient connection is ensured by direct MPLS VPN.
IPsec improves security for the sensitive data link (LAN A).

Requirement 4: Placement of SQL Server

Implementation:

Install the SQL server on the LDS PRODUCTION 1 LAN.

Justification:

Because of the shorter network distance (80 km) and higher available bandwidth (70 Mbps), performance modeling favors LDS PRODUCTION 1.

Requirement 5: Access Restriction for NCL PRODUCTION 2

Implementation:

Configure access control lists (ACLs) on NCL PRODUCTION 2 to prevent traffic from reaching the MAN_HO EXEC LAN.

Justification:

ACLs prohibit illegal access and enforce security policies.

Requirement 6: Router Security

Implementation:

On all routers, implement basic security features such as password protection and access control lists (ACLs).

Justification:

Improves overall network security by restricting access and guarding against unwanted changes.

Requirement 7: Efficient IP Addressing and DHCP

Implementation:

Create a reliable IP addressing scheme for all routers.
Configure DHCP on client routers to assign IP addresses automatically.

Justification:

IP addressing that is efficient maximizes resource use.
By automating address assignment, DHCP simplifies IP management.

Section 3: Strategy for Implementation, Testing, and Troubleshooting

Implementation Plan:

Configure all routers' basic router settings and security measures.
Create MPLS VPN connections.
Configure IPsec for secure connections.
Use ACLs to implement access controls.
Configure effective IP addressing and DHCP.

Troubleshooting and testing:

To ensure proper implementation, use the'show' and 'debug' commands at each stage.
Connectivity between directly linked routers should be tested.
Use'show mpls ldp neighbor' and'show mpls l2transport vc' to validate MPLS VPN connections.
Use'show crypto isakmp sa' and'show crypto ipsec sa' to confirm IPsec setups.
Simulated traffic is used to test ACLs and access controls.
Check leases and client connectivity to ensure DHCP operation.

Remedy Solutions:

If any step fails, use the'show' and 'debug' commands to inspect configurations for issues.
For troubleshooting advice, see the manual and the Cisco forums.
If necessary, revert to a previous configuration and reevaluate the implementation strategy.
For challenging situations, collaborate with team members or seek external assistance.

This thorough strategy offers a logical and progressive approach to network implementation, with testing and troubleshooting procedures built in to assure a robust and error-free configuration.
